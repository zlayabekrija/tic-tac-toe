## Tic Tac Toe game 

 This project is the collaboration of [Zlatan](https://github.com/zlayabekrija) & [Inzi](https://github.com/inhaq).

To learn and practise our knowledge in OOP and Ruby, we have built a console based game of

Tic Tac Toe.

-   You can start playing the game by runing **ttt.rb** file.
    
-   Game will ask for Player 1 and Player 2 names ,after that each will be assigned with the symbol of 'X' for player 1, and 'O' for player 2.
    
-   Next is game play ,where players will be choosing positions from the playing grid that will be displayed ,and updated according to their choices.
